# Introduction
This application is for candidates who want to find jobs and recruiters who want to hire candidates for some specific role. 
I have used clerk and supabase in this application for user authentication and database management with interactive UI. Live link will be provided soon!!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Sign in to avail the services of Supabase and Clerk.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/).
